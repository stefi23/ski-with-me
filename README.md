# Ski with me

## What is the goal?

I want to go skiing but most of my friends who ski are in Romania.

I would love to have a directory app where I can can look up people based on a resort and message them to pair up for a ski day, so I am building it â›·

> **Main goal:** connect skiers/snowboarders with each other so they can go ski/snowboard together.

## How to install it and get started

Create a database named skiBuddies locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/stefi23/ski-with-me
$ cd ski-with-me
$ npm run migrate
$ npm start
```

Open another terminal window:

```
$ cd ski-with-me
$ cd client
$ npm start
```

## When? (Situation)

When you want to go skiing/snowboarding in a specific place but none of your friends cand join you or you are new in a town with no skier/boarder friends and would like some company.

You then go to this database and look for buddies. In a way it's an app for ski/snowboard hangouts.

## So I can? (Expected outcome)

Fomd someone or more people to go skiing/snowboarding with.
